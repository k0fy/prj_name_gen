# Create version names as those used in Ubuntu, but with creatures of mythology rather than common animals and in a twisted way.

The name is generated randomly.

All the cratures have been gotten from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_legendary_creatures)
Gods and Demigods have been omitted

How it works:

Just run "generador.py" in the command line

the generator will answer with the version name, the origen of the creature and a basic description of the creature:
example:

&
$ generador.py

generador.py
version: 1.0.0 - Dependent Griffin

=> Disdainful Suzaku
::Japanese
 ::Japanese version of the Chinese Vermillion Bird

Some results:
  Demagogical Shtriga
  Resentful Duende
  Unreliable Zombie
